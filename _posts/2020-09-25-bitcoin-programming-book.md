Some time ago I have started a series of blog posts to introduce Bitcoin programming. However, I soon realized that the material would be better presented in a book format. Thus, the beginning of my new project, a [Bitcoin programming book](/assets/bitcoin-textbook.pdf) licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0. The book aims to help software engineers start Bitcoin programming but it is not intended for complete beginners. Still, the introductory chapters attempt to summarize what you need to know to progress with the rest of the material.

It aims to be a practical guide and thus is full of examples either in the command-line or using Python programs. The examples are based in the open source Bitcoin library, [python-bitcoin-utils](https://github.com/karask/python-bitcoin-utils) that I have created for educational purposes while teaching Bitcoin programming for some years now at several universities.

To sum up, the Bitcoin tutorial blog posts will stop and instead I will be updating the book. It is work in progress but it already has quite substantive material. If you would like to [contribute](https://github.com/karask/bitcoin-textbook) feel free to make a PR (and please provide just text, if latex is not to your liking, and I will adjust appropriately).
