<h4>BITCOIN LIBRARY</h4>

Building a [Bitcoin library](https://github.com/karask/python-bitcoin-utils){:target="_blank"} that provides tools/utilities to interact with the Bitcoin network. One of the primary goals of the library is to explain the low-level details of Bitcoin. The code is easy to read and properly documented explaining in detail all the thorny aspects of the implementation. It is a low-level library which assumes some high-level understanding of how Bitcoin works. In the future this might change. 

This is an early version of the library (v0.4.3) and currently, it supports private/public keys, all type of addresses (incl.segwit) and creation of P2PKH, P2SH and segwit transactions (with all SIGHASH types). All script op codes are included. Timelock and non-standanrd transactions are supported. Currently, a simple node proxy exists to enable easy calls to a Bitcoin core node. Additional functionality will be added continuously and the documentation will be improved as the work progresses. I use this library in the courses that I teach (University of Nicosia, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki and in seminars).


<h4>BLOCKCHAIN CERTIFICATES</h4>

Has architected and implemented the University of Nicosia's blockchain certificate platform which enables easy, fast and independent publishing verification of certificates/diplomas/etc. More details on the [website](http://block.co/){:target="_blank"} and on [github](https://github.com/verifiable-pdfs){:target="_blank"}. A certificate [validator](http://verify.unic.ac.cy/verify){:target="_blank"} (using the open source code) was set up for the University of Nicosia. Currently, only Bitcoin is supported but the infrastructure exists for other platforms. Also created a library ([Blockchain-Proofs](https://github.com/karask/blockchain-proofs){:target="_blank"}) to allow blockchain certificates validation which currently supports [Chainpoint v2](http://www.chainpoint.org/){:target="_blank"} but might incorporate/wrap others in the future (e.g. [OpenTimestamps](https://github.com/opentimestamps){:target="_blank"}).

Has also contributed on MIT's Media Lab/Learning Machine blockchain certificates project, blockcerts.


<h4>RAISING BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY AWARENESS</h4>

Currently organizing, talking and being active in local meetups and events throughout Greece, e.g. [Thessaloniki's](https://www.meetup.com/BlockchainGreece-1/){:target="_blank"} and [Athen's](https://www.meetup.com/BlockchainGreece-0/){:target="_blank"} meetups, and guest lecturing in academic institutions, doing both introductory and more advanced technical talks.

Also written an "_Introduction to Bitcoin for new users_" available in [pdf](/assets/introductionToBitcoin.pdf), [epub](/assets/introductionToBitcoin.epub), and [mobi](/assets/introductionToBitcoin.mobi) (outdated, written in 2016).

#### BITCOIN APPLICATIONS

Developed a Point of Sale application for merchants that wish to accept Bitcoins. The need arose in the meetups when some users asked for more features than other solutions. You can find it in play store [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gr.cryptocurrencies.bitcoinpos&hl=en){:target="_blank"} (outdated).

Developed a simple quiz application to test your Bitcoin knowledge at different levels. There are around 150 questions right now but more are added occasionally. You can find it in play store [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gr.cryptocurrencies.bitcoinchallenge&hl=en){:target="_blank"} (outdated).

<!--Currently developing a combination of Bitcoin wallet and Proof of Existence solution but progress is slow due to time shortage.-->

<h4>WORKFLOW TECHNOLOGY</h4>

Worked with [workflows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflow){:target="_blank"} for several years both in academia and in the bioinformatics industry. The output of that work was several open source contributions, like [OGSA-DAI](http://www.ogsadai.org.uk){:target="_blank"} that included a workflow engine to capture federation rules, [Taverna Workflows to Web application](https://rubygems.org/gems/t2-web){:target="_blank"}, [Workflows to Galaxy](https://rubygems.org/gems/workflow-to-galaxy){:target="_blank"} and the [MyExperiment REST API library](https://rubygems.org/gems/myexperiment-rest){:target="_blank"}.

#### DISTRIBUTED DATA ACCESS AND MANAGEMENT

Member of the [OGSA-DAI project](http://www.ogsadai.org.uk/){:target="_blank"} for 4.5 years years working on data federation and access via web services, grids, or clouds. Conducted research on improving the architecture of OGSA-DAI and demonstrated new ideas with prototypes as well as acted as a bridge between the academic research and the development team. 

#### EVEN OLDER PROJECTS

Very early projects involved both low- and high-level technical expertise. Some examples of low-level projects were: a Linux bootstrap sequence, a simple floppy device driver and porting C/C++ projects to Windows, e.g. the [OGSA-DQP](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5070877/){:target="_blank"} software.

Higher-level projects included an editor, libraries to create text menus (back in the day) and some networking applications like a chat server/client and a MUD.
